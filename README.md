## Final Year Project - Online Voting System

This project was undertaken my me during my final year at Ulster University, The aim of this project was to create a modern, scalable, secure web application that would allow users to sign up on an electoral register, cast their vote online and view results of elections A strong emphasis has been placed on security in order to protect user information with modern security practices being adhered to such as the use of 2-factor-authentication (2fa) to a registered email address, CAPTCHAs to prevent mass bot sign up, web tokens, password encryption and form validators. This project also provides a functional and friendly user experience that will provide users with a convenient means of taking part in the democratic process.

I am happy with the project in its current state and enjoyed working on it, especially the second half of the year where I really got into a good routine of development, there could be quality of life changes that may need to be added as I tried to improve as much as possible but that is work for the future.
